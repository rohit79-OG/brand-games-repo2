## 2. Core Concept

**KS Endless Embrace** focuses on maintaining an undisturbed romantic atmosphere. The game screen features stylized silhouettes of couples in various Kamasutra poses. Periodically, "distractions" like ringing alarm clocks, phone notifications, or work calls appear, and players must eliminate these distractions within a very short timeframe (1.5-2 seconds) to prevent the couple from being "rudely disturbed."

This concept emphasises the importance of uninterrupted intimacy and keeping external factors away for lasting intimate moments, directly aligning with the brand's "3X Longer Lasting" messaging.

### Core Philosophy:
- **Focus & Attention**: Maintaining concentration during intimate moments
- **External Interference**: Real-world distractions that disrupt connection
